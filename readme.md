# Logseq Plugin Toggle Heading

## What it does

Provides a command to toggle `heading` as a boolean property

## Why?

If `heading` is true, then the heading level is determined by the current depth of the branch. If you zoom into a node heading that's three levels deep and rendered as `h3`, then it's rendered as an `h1` in the new view. I prefer this more flexible view of my page sections.
