# Logseq Plugin Toggle Heading

## What it does

Provides a *Toggle Heading* command to toggle `heading` as a boolean property. This can also be triggered with `mod-1`.

There are no additional interfaces or customizations.

## Why?

If `heading` is true, then the heading level is determined by the current depth of the branch. If you zoom into a node heading that's three levels deep and rendered as `h3`, then it's rendered as an `h1` in the new view. I prefer this more flexible view of my page sections.
